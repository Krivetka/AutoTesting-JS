2. Use https://demoqa.com/ web application. Write 5 Test Scenarios:
2.1 https://demoqa.com/alerts. Cover functionality with all buttons. Check alerts.
2.2 https://demoqa.com/automation-practice-form. Fill all fields. Check result.
2.3 https://demoqa.com/text-box. Fill text box with random data. Check result
2.4 https://demoqa.com/tool-tips. Сheck text on all tooltips.
2.5 https://demoqa.com/select-menu. Cover functionality with dropdowns. Select Value - Group 2, option 1. Select One - Other. Old Style Select Menu - Green. Multiselect drop down - Black, Blue.

3. Implement Page Object Model:
Create separate files/classes for each page (e.g. `MainPage.js`, `FormPage.js`).
In each file, define methods for interacting with page elements (e.g. `clickButton()`, `fillForm()`)
4. Perform Cross-Browser Testing - Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox
5. Error Handling. Set up automatic screenshot saving for tests that fail.
6. Set up reporting for tests.
7. Give the lecturer access rights to the git repository.
8. Tests cases 2.2 and 2.3 should contain mandatory field validation. All tests should have negative scenarios.


The project is set up, the basic POM structure is implemented.
Tests for two scenarios (2.1 and 2.2) are written and successfully run.
Tests are run in Google Chrome.
All 5 test scenarios are implemented and run successfully.
Tests are run in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
Error handling is enabled (saving screenshots).
Tests are checked on two screen resolutions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- The project is configured using one of the selected frameworks (WebdriverIO, Cypress or Playwright).
- At least 5 test scenarios are written, each using different locator strategies.
- Tests are organized using the Page Object Model.
- Parameterized tests with multiple data sets are used.
- Tests are run automatically via CI/CD (e.g. GitHub Actions). Every day and by merge (pull) request.
- Tests run successfully in Chrome and Firefox.
- Test run with resolutions 1920x1080 and 1366x768. Launch by flags `VIEWPORT_WIDTH` and `VIEWPORT_HEIGHT`.
- The tests are configured to run in parallel. Launch by flag `workers`.
- Any separate test scenario are configured to run by keyword. Launch by flag `runThis`.
- Test scenarios contain only automatically generated data.
- Screenshots are automatically saved in case of errors.
- A detailed report on the results of test execution is generated and saving as an artifact in github.
- The README file contains a description of how to run automated tests.
